## Project Overview: 
This is a website for an outdoor guide service company. The website scales to match screen size and keeps all images and texts properly displayed. This website provides information on the types of guide services and locations offered by the guide service. It allows the user to sumbit forms to the guide service that provide information about the user and the type of guide service, location, and date the user wants.
